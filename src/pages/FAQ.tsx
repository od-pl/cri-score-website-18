    question: "How is CRI different from CGPA or traditional grades?",
    answer: "While CGPA measures academic performance in specific subjects, CRI evaluates career readiness across five critical dimensions: Cognitive, Functional, Adaptive, Social-Emotional, and Literacy skills. CRI provides a comprehensive view of job readiness that employers actually care about, making it a better predictor of workplace success than traditional grades.",

  }, {
    question: "Is PLAT compliant with NAAC and NEP 2020 requirements?",
    answer: "Yes, PLAT is fully aligned with NAAC's student outcome assessment criteria and NEP 2020's emphasis on skill-based education. Our framework helps institutions demonstrate measurable student outcomes, which is crucial for NAAC accreditation. Many of our partner colleges have seen significant improvements in their NAAC scores after implementing PLAT.",
    icon: Shield
  }, {
    question: "What is the cost structure for implementing PLAT?",
    answer: "Our pricing is flexible and based on your institution's size and requirements. We offer per-student pricing starting from â‚¹299 per assessment, with significant discounts for bulk implementations. We also provide free pilot programs for institutions to evaluate our impact before full deployment. Contact us for a customized quote.",
    icon: DollarSign
  }, {
    question: "What kind of support do you provide during implementation?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive support including: dedicated account manager, faculty training sessions, student orientation programs, technical support, regular progress reviews, and custom reporting. Our team works closely with your T&P cell to ensure smooth implementation and maximum benefit realization.",
    icon: Phone
  }, {
    question: "How long does it take to see results?",
    answer: "Most institutions see initial insights within the first month of implementation. Significant improvements in student outcomes typically become visible within one semester (3-4 months). Full transformation, including improved placement rates and NAAC scores, usually takes 6-12 months depending on the level of engagement.",
    icon: MessageCircle
  }, {
    question: "Can PLAT integrate with our existing systems (LMS, ERP)?",
    answer: "Yes, PLAT offers API-based integration with most popular LMS and ERP systems. We can seamlessly integrate with platforms like Moodle, Canvas, SAP, Oracle, and others. Our technical team handles the integration process to ensure minimal disruption to your existing workflows.",
    icon: Shield
  }, {
    question: "How do you ensure data privacy and security?",
    answer: "We take data security very seriously. PLAT uses AES-256 encryption, is ISO 27001 compliant, and follows GDPR guidelines. All student data is stored securely and access is strictly controlled. We also offer on-premises deployment options for institutions with specific security requirements.",
    icon: Shield
  }, {
    question: "What makes PLAT different from other assessment tools?",
    answer: "PLAT is unique because it: 1) Uses AI-powered assessment for accurate skill mapping, 2) Provides actionable improvement paths through micro-learning, 3) Offers real-time tracking and progress monitoring, 4) Aligns with Indian regulatory requirements (NAAC, NEP), 5) Includes employer validation and job matching features, 6) Focuses on outcome-based education rather than just assessment.",
